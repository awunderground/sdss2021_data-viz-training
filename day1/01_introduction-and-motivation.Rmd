# Why `ggplot2`

### 1. Looks good!

`library(ggplot2)` is used by [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-56-best-and-weirdest-charts-we-made-in-2019/), [Financial Times](https://johnburnmurdoch.github.io/slides/r-ggplot/#/), [BBC](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/), the [Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/r-at-urban/graphics-guide.html), and more. 

### 2. Flexible and expressive

By breaking data visualization into component parts, `library(ggplot2)` is a set of building blocks instead of a set of rigid cookie cutters. 

### 3. Reproducible

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("www", "images", "show-your-work.png"))

```

### 4. Scalable

It's almost as easy to make the 100th chart as it is to make the 2nd chart. This allows for [iteration](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/projects/state-fiscal-briefs). 

### 5. In my analysis workflow

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("www", "images", "parallel.gif"))

```

Data visualization is fundamental to EDA, statistical modeling, and basically any work with data. Too many people find themselves using different tools for data visualization and statistical modeling. R/ggplot2 allows everything to happen in the same script at the same time. 

# R Markdown

* [R Studio Tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

This short course will rely on R Markdown, which is a literate statistical programming framework that combines text and images, code, and code output into output documents like PDFs and web pages. It is like an easier-to-use LaTeX with more flexibility. Instead of .R scripts, we will use .Rmd scripts. 

1. Markdown
2. YAML Header
3. Code chunks

### Running code in documents

We will mostly run code inside of .Rmd documents. 

1. Run the code like a .R script
2. Run the entire current chunk

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("www", "images", "run-chunk-above.png"))

```

3. Run all chunks above

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("www", "images", "run-chunk.png"))

```

### Knitting documents

More commonly, documents are knitted. This runs all of the code in the .Rmd in a new R session and then creates an output document like a .html or a .pdf. If the code has errors, knitting will fail.

To knit, click this button in RStudio when a .Rmd file is open:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("www", "images", "knit.png"))

```

### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Exercise 1", color = "#1696d2")`

<font color="#55b748">Step 1:</font> Open RStudio by double-clicking `sdss2021_data-viz-training.Rproj`

<font color="#55b748">Step 2:</font> Open `02_workbook.Rmd` in RStudio. Make sure it is in the `.Rproj`.

<font color="#55b748">Step 3:</font> Click knit!
